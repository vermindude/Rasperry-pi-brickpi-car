 # How to build rapberry pi brickpi car
 
 to build a raspberry pi lego car you will need a [BrickPi](https://www.amazon.com/BrickPi-by-Dexter-Industries/dp/B01M4JG4GD) and a [RaspberryPi](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-MS-004-00000024-Model-Board/dp/B01LPLPBS8/ref=sr_1_4?gclid=Cj0KCQiA4NTxBRDxARIsAHyp6gDy8XmtfL8nYTCF--iw3lSYTQaSGfpQYF8gU15nh1i7xBY9kQqMnqoaAkPOEALw_wcB&hvadid=409975553966&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9023847&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=17444722183821711918&hvtargid=kwd-300229776225&hydadcr=18067_11398848&keywords=raspberry+pi+raspberry+pi+3+model+b&qid=1580595740&sr=8-4) you have to get a raspberry pi 3 or this will not work. You can use you own ev3 parts and motors.
 
 You will also need a wireless acess via usb chip. you will need a pc with ssh and a console
 
 
 # Setting up the raspberry pi
 
 first you need to get [raspbian](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/install-raspbian-for-robots-image-on-an-sd-card/) and brickpi for robots on the same site. Make sure that you burn the image to the disk not just copy it the it on to the sd card or it will not work. When you connect the Brickpi to the Raspberry pi you attach them via the prongs.
 
 you will need a battery pack for powering the raspberry pi and the brickpi. you will need a moniter to connect the pi to the internet like this : [how to connect pi to internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cQrNl0QVFA).
 
 # Building the chassis
 
 When you build the chassis there is many ways to build it with suspension, differential locks, steering collums and many other things. there are many youtube videos on how to build all of these. make sure that you have enough room to fit all of you things, you need more than you think.
 
 Here is an example of what you can build: ![example image](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mochub.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2017-12%2Fsteering-with-lowering-suspension_copy.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mochub.com%2Fmoc%2Fheight-adjustable-suspension-unit&tbnid=Ts5vXusEYripLM&vet=12ahUKEwji4tXazbHnAhVWCs0KHRt6CygQMygLegUIARCmAg..i&docid=hl_tiZqYJL3U8M&w=800&h=600&q=lego%20car%20with%20suspension&ved=2ahUKEwji4tXazbHnAhVWCs0KHRt6CygQMygLegUIARCmAghttps://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mochub.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2017-12%2Fsteering-with-lowering-suspension_copy.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mochub.com%2Fmoc%2Fheight-adjustable-suspension-unit&tbnid=Ts5vXusEYripLM&vet=12ahUKEwji4tXazbHnAhVWCs0KHRt6CygQMygLegUIARCmAg..i&docid=hl_tiZqYJL3U8M&w=800&h=600&q=lego%20car%20with%20suspension&ved=2ahUKEwji4tXazbHnAhVWCs0KHRt6CygQMygLegUIARCmAg)
